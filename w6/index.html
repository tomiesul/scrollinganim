    <section>The Moon and Earth exert a gravitational pull on each other. On Earth, the Moon's gravitational pull causes the oceans to bulge out on both the side closest to the Moon and the side farthest from the Moon. These bulges create high tides. The low points are where low tides occur. Twice a month, when the Earth, Sun, and Moon line up, their gravitational power combines to make exceptionally high tides, called spring tides, as well as very low tides where the water has been displaced. When the Sun is at a right angle to the Moon, moderate tides, called neap tides, result. From our view on Earth, these tides coincide with certain lunar phases since they occur when the Moon reaches specific positions in its orbit.</section>
